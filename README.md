Hello, 
My name is Imani Hedgeman and I am a 2020 Informatics college grad who excels in SQL and has strong knowledge with Excel, Tableau, and Python. In my free time I enjoy working on Sports data analytics projects. I have learned that data runs the world, and allows people to discover new information everyday and that's exciting! As a D1 college athlete I have learned skills such as leadership, teamwork, commitment, and perseverance to create my grit mindset and develop me into a well-rounded employee.
Thank you for taking the time to look through my Github.
